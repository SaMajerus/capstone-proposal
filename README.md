# Research & Planning Log
### Friday, 12/02
* 8:20-8:30:  Research how to duplicate an existing Unity project
* 8:30-9:00:  Create local project folder and files.  Create & format this README. 
* 9:00:  Copy down Proposal template (in 'capstone-proposal.md') 
* 9:15-30:  Create GitHub repo.  Initialize local repo, make inital commit, push to remote repo. 
* 9:30-40:  Adjusted the formatting of this README, made edits. 
* 9:45:  Open Unity editor, export C# Team Week project. 
* 10:00:  Create and open new Unity project (with '3D' template).  
* 10:15:  Import the exported C# Team Week project.   [On break for tea, stretching, ...]
* 11:45:  Searching Unity Asset Store for backpack leaf-blower, leaf/leaves, etc. 
  * 11:53:  Add Free 'hair dryer' asset to "My Assets" [for Unity] 
  * 12:09:  Add free 'simplistic low poly nature' asset pack to "My Assets" 

<!-- * [12:30-13:10:  Added links to job postings I saved yesterday to my Job Tracker, for further evaluation later.]   -->

* 13:40:  Attempt to fix apparent issues/missing assets (i.e. those that were not included in Export package) --
* 14:00:  Copying 'csharpteamweek' project from PlasticSCM workspace directory to UnityHub's ProjectTemplates folder. 
* 14:30:  Attempting to create a new project in Unity Hub using the newly-copied root directory as the template. 
* 14:40:  Deleting failed project attempts,  looking further into process of adding a Custom Template for Unity.   ('csharpteamweek' didn't show up as a Template option.)
* 15:15:  Creating new project file with generic 3D template (since I can't figure out custom templates).  
* 15:20:  Using Package Manager to import select Assets from the two newly-added Asset Packs.  
* 15:25:  Importing the 'csharpteamweek' project's package.  
* 15:30:  Saved the project, closing Unity Editor. (Import of the Team Week project's exported package was successful.)   [Updating activity log] 
* 15:45:  Beginning work on Capstone Proposal. 
* 16:45:  Pushing this entry and the Proposal document to remote repo.  
<br><br>



### Friday, 12/09
* 10:05:  Researching how to start/add my own PlasticSCM repo (for Source Control) for the Project. 
<!-- * 10:30:  Researching how to change the gameplay environment without accidentally interfering with the player's current HUD and Menu scenes.  -->
* 10:30:  Figuring out how to edit Scripts in VS Code. 
* 10:45:  Determining next steps
* 11:15:  Start re-familiarizing myself with the C# code from Team-Week project 
* 11:40:  Figure out how to replace 'keyboard-gun' asset/object with Hair-dryer asset/object.  (While keeping the same scripts, at least initially.)
  * 11:55:  Continuing above investigation in Unity Editor instead of VS Code (for now) 
* 12:10:  Remaking Unity project (due to root folder naming issue that prevents me from navigating back to it in Cmd-Line).
* 13:00:  Lunch break

* 14:15:  Initializing/setting up Local and Remote Git repos (with '.gitignore' imported from Team-Week project) for the Unity project. 
* 14:40:  Continuing task from 1140. 
<!-- * 15:15:  Slight detour to finish -- and submit -- first of two job applications. -->
* 15:45:  Continuing task from 1140. 
* 16:25:  The Hair-dryer -- I mean, Leaf-blower -- is now positioned so that it's on-top-of/clipping-into the Keyboard-gun's location in space (in the player's virtual hands).    [WIP:   task from 1140, part 2; switch out Keyboard object with the Hair-dryer, keeping the existing scripts (applied to the object) as they are for now.]
<br><br>



### Tuesday, 12/13 
* 14:45:  Exploring Hierarchy of Game Scene, comparing/contrasting Hairdryer Asset's components with that of the ''Keyboard-gun''.   
* 15:38:  Looked up the definition of 'LOD' in the context of Unity 3D. [It's short for 'Level of Detail'.]   
* 15:40-16:30:  (Same as 1445.) 

* 16:35:  Doing more research on how I can swap one Asset for another in Unity (without having to re-attach Scripts/other components to the new Asset.) 
* 16:45:  Reached out to Skylan  (teammate from the C# Team-Week project)  for tips/suggestions/help on how to proceed with Asset swapping  [especially given how we structured our 'Player' prefab hierarchy-wise in that project].  
* 17:10:  Searched Asset Store for Free particle effects (i.e. Wind/breeze effects) and/or physics "materials" (i.e. 'block' of air, blast of air, air/wind gust effects and/or physics, ''parcel of air'').  
  - Even after 8 minutes of searching intently, I found nothing that matching what I want. 
    * There <em>was</em> a "Low Poly Wind Effects" package, <em>but</em> it costs $15, which is ridiculous!    (If I can't manage to improvise with the 3D Physics that Unity provides by default, <em>I guess</em> I'll buy it.) 
<br><br>



### Wednesday, 12/14 
* 10:30:  Doing Log entry for 12/13 (since I forgot to yesterday). 
<!-- * 11:10:  Formatting edits in this document.  -->
* 11:30:  Attaching components (which were attached to the Keyboard when I deleted it) to 'Hairdryer' object/Asset. 
  -Yesterday, before deleting the Keyboard object, I went through and took screenshots of the components attached to it. (This ensures that I know exactly what to attach to the Hairdryer object/Asset.)  
<!-- * 11:55:  (Went to Lunch.) -->
<br><br>



### Friday, 12/16
* 9:45:  Researching how to set/change physical size attributes of an Asset/Game-Object in Unity 3D editor. 
  - I want to make the length of the Hairdryer's main body about double what it is now  (so that it resembles an actual Leaf-blower's tube).  
* 10:__:  








<!-- [Example entry]
* 1:20: implement react-spring library in sample project 
-->
