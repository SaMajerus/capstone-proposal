### Leaf-blowing Simulator

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The player can get an idea for how leaf-blowing works, so that the learning curve is easier when they start using one in real-life. (Basically, provide an environment that is at least semi-realistic compared to real-life, so that prospective first-time users have a sort of reference point for learning.)


#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 
* Working leafblower physics -- can blow objects around. 
* Player can move around. 
* Player can use "Leaf-Blower" on objects, and have those objects respond accordingly with some realism (e.g. simple physics) 


#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific. 
* C#
* Unity Editor
* online tutorials for Unity 3D (i.e. for object physics, scripting, etc)
* PlasticSCM for version control 
* (Other technologies utilized by the C# Team Week project that I'm forgetting currently)


#### If you finish developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/functional-programming-with-javascript/capstone-planning-the-minimum-viable-product) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific. 
* Advanced leaf-blower output-air physics (so that it's closer to real-life) 
* sound bytes (idling engine, full-blast, varying-levels of power, air-object interaction sounds. Startup/shut-down sounds.   Rustling leaves.)
* Add keybinds so that the player can pivot/move the nozzle 30-45 degrees Left or Right in a frontal arc, whilst still being able to move around. 
* Add keybinds that allow one to vary the power settings. 
* Create a player HUD (and/or UI) that shows where the nozzle is located in the frontal arc, currently-selected amount of blowing power, etc.   


#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require? 
* Recordings of leaf-blower i have at home, at different power settings.  (with iPhone -- probably using Voice Memos app)
* Any-/Every-thing else:  TBD 


#### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? 
Couldn't find a Leaf-blower asset, so I'm improvising with a hair-dryer Asset and a backpack Asset (for the character, at least).
